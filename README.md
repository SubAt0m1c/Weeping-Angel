# Weeping Angel datapack

This datapack adds functionality for weeping angels in a multiplayer environment, or with mobs.

## Installation and usage:

Place the .zip file into your "datapacks" folder located in your selected world's folder, ex: .minecraft > saves > New World > datapacks

Give whatever mob or player you want the pack to work on the "weeping" tag, it should then work fully.
If you want the Weeping Angel to have extra buffs when not being looked at, just run a command with @e[tag=weeping,tag=!find_looking.result]

## sources:
[FindLooking datapack by HalbFettKaese](https://github.com/HalbFettKaese/FindLooking/releases/tag/v1.0), solely used to determine what is being looked at, probably overcomplicated for this use case but I don't care. The pack will also have unintended side effects if you use this source for anything else.

## Side notes: 
This pack was designed for a Halloween server a few friends and I are building, I don't care if you use it for anything, I don't even want credit, but you should probably build your own with presumably less jank and more suited for your own needs. I have written comments on the functions of everything I wrote if you want to copy the commands and don't know what you're doing. 

I also don't know if HalbFettKaese cares if other people implement their pack into their own, I could probably make this pack use it as a dependency or something similar, but I generally don't like the idea of dependencies. 

Updated 11/14/22, confirmed to work on Minecraft version(s) 1.19.2
